## Overview of the statistical analysis:

Kate is looking to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Kate wants to solidify her proposal to the stakeholders by presenting them with statistical insights backed with using NYC bike sharing program. Information about bike share usage during the weekdays, peak hours, and bike usage by gender is presented to the stakeholders using tableau. 

## Results:

1) The line chart below shows the bike share duration of users in NYC. Users at most take use the bike share program for about five minutes. Very few users use the bike shares for over an hour. The second line chart shows the bike share duration of users in NYC by gender. Males are most share bike users in NYC; about triple the number of female and unknown users.

## Summary:
With the data and the plots shown above, we can predict the popular bike usage times, pick up and drop off locations, and users demographics for the bike share program. This will help investors and planners build future bike racks and marketing towards certain demographics. 
Two additional visualizations for future analysis:
1) Subscription length of unique users
2) Top pickup and drop-off locations during the weekday’s peak hours.
